## Redis data structures

To implement the most articles category I will use a Redis sorted set with key "leaderboard", Category name as the values and a score of the number of articles of the category.

To implement the newest articles I will use a Redis HashMap with key "newestArticles:count", title, category,pubDate,status as the values.

## How to Start

mongoimport --db articleSystem --collection category --file user.json --jsonArray   
```
